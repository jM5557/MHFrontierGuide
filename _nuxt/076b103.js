In order for the client to start, you must run this file as administrator EVERY TIME you want to play the game. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting **Run as Administrator**\n\n**Tip:** If you do NOT want to go through this step every time you wish to play the game, you can **right-click > Create Shortchut** Next, make this shortcut always run as administrator via **right-click > Properties > Advanced > Run as Administrator**\n\n![create shortcut](assets/images/troubleshooting-create-client-shortcut-0.jpg)\n\n![run shortcut as admin](assets/images/troubleshooting-create-client-shortcut-1.jpg)\n\n## Game does not start after running the client\n\nIf you run the client and then see a window mail-carrier Felyne and Japanese text on the right-side, then you forgot to run the server! The server is not running, which means the client is unable to authenticate and connect.\n\nIf you completed the initial setup successfully, then double-click the file run_server.bat and run_client.bat afterwards.\n\n![felyne that has fallen and can\'t get up](assets/images/troubleshooting-servers-down.jpg)\n'}}]);
